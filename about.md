I am a foreign language expert who codes. Having spent last twelve years of my life studying foreign cultures, translating and teaching human languages (primarily Russian and German), I decided to delve into the language of machines, i.e. software. 

It has been a wonderful journey. My original fascination with coding can be tracked back to observing "magical" things that became a part of everyday life: video calls, Alexa with its evergrowing number of skills, the RoboSnail. The list goes on. Similar items can be found in the old literature: for instance, Väinamöinen from the Finnish national epic 'Kalevala' has a broom that sweeps by itself. In the text, such wonders are linked to magic. Yet, this magic broom does not hold a candle to my iRobot! In my quest to understand how ancient ideas become today's reality, I embarked on studying software engineering at Bloc.    

As I learn more about coding, both my understanding of how things work and my appreciation of everyday magic are growing.
