## Explanation

BlocJams is a result of my first exposure to web development. In concord with the [Bloc's](http://www.bloc.io/){:target="_blank"} philosophy to _Learn by doing_, this project was designed to introduce HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to students while they were building it. My final product is a web app that simulates an online music streaming service. It allows users to choose, skip, and pause songs, has a functional play and sound bars as well as a timer. 

## Task

The first phase of building this app involved creating CSS and HTML files for the app's pages,  writing vanilla JavaScript code and employing jQuery as well as [Buzz library](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/){:target="_blank"} . Once the app was fully operational, I refractored it with AngularJS. 

## Results

This experience allowed me to gain understanding of the basic building blocs of web development. It shed some light on how and when to use AngularJS, jQuery, and vanilla JavaScript. In addition, I learned how to seek help online and became a frequent visitor to such sites as [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/){:target="_blank"} and [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/){:target="_blank"} . 

Please see my source code for [the Angular version](https://github.com/vfinney2/bloc-jams-angular){:target =_blank"} or the [vanilla Javascript](https://github.com/vfinney2/bloc-jams){:target="_blank"} .

I am looking forward to using my newly acquired skills to build my own, original projects.
